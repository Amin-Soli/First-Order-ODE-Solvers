# This program has been written in the form of Object-Oriented Programming in C++ (Class).

# This program solves first order ODE equation with four different methods and compares the numerical solution to the exact solution.

# Four different methods consist of Euler, Modified Euler, 2nd order of Runge-Kutta and 4th order of Runge-Kutta.

# This program consists of two folders: 
  * One folder which is named "libs", includes all required classes to solve the problem
  * Another folder which is named "solver", includes your main code file ("main.cpp") 

# If you want to run this program, all you need to do is:
  1. Go to "solver" folder
  2. Open "main.cpp" file
  3. Define the derivative of y (f(t,y) function) and the exact y (exact_y(t,y) function)
  4. Enter required data into input data section 
  5. Compile "main.cpp" file and then run
